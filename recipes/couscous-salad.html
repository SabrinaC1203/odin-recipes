<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This couscous salad is light, vibrant, and packed with Mediterranean flavor. Fluffy couscous forms the base, tossed with cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, and crumbled feta cheese. A simple lemon-olive oil dressing ties it all together with a tangy finish. </p>

    <p> Ideal as a side dish or light main course, it’s great served cold or at room temperature. The feta adds a creamy, salty punch that complements the crisp vegetables. For added texture and freshness, herbs like mint or parsley make excellent additions.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Salad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups uncooked couscous</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¾ cup coarsely chopped fresh spinach</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sweetened dried cranberries</li>
        <li>⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Dressing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Dash of pepper</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water, 1 teaspoon salt and butter to a boil. Stir in the couscous, cover the pot and remove from the heat. Let the pot stand (covered) for 5 minutes.

        <li>Once the couscous is cool, gently stir in the spinach, cranberries and feta.</li>
        <li>Whisk together all of the dressing ingredients (or shake them in a jar). Pour over the salad and toss to coat. Season with additional salt and pepper, to taste. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready to enjoy.</li>
