<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This salmon and lemon pasta recipe is a bright, flavorful dish that brings together the richness of salmon 
    with the zesty freshness of lemon. A light, creamy sauce made with onion, lemon zest, and a splash of cream 
    coats each strand, balancing the buttery salmon with a refreshing citrus lift. </p>

    <p> Ideal for a quick weeknight dinner or a casual yet elegant meal, this pasta is satisfying without being heavy. 
    Whether you're using fresh or leftover salmon, the dish comes together quickly and can be easily customized 
    with ingredients like spinach, capers, or chili flakes for a bit of heat. </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>170 g graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>74 g unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Cheesecake</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>680 g cream cheese</li>
        <li>200 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Topping</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ lb fresh or frozen strawberries</li>
        <li>50 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ Tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon butter salted or unsalted</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 160C.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Stir in the melted butter until all of the graham cracker crumbs are moistened.</li>
        <li>Press the graham cracker mixture evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9” springform pan. Use the bottom and sides of a glass to help do this. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and sugar using an electric mixer on medium-low speed until smooth, creamy, and completely combined. Scrape the side and bottom of the bowl with a spatula to ensure the ingredients are thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sour cream and vanilla extract until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring until just combined after each addition. Do not over-mix or cheesecake will puff in the oven when baking.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared springform pan and bake at 325F (160C) for 45-50 minutes. The center will be slightly jiggly but the cheesecake should be mostly set.</li>
        <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature until it’s no longer warm then transfer it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 6 hours. Preferably, let it sit overnight. Do not remove the springform collar until you are ready to serve.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch. Add half of the strawberries, the water, and the lemon juice and set the stovetop to medium/low heat. Stir constantly until the strawberries release their juices and begin to fall apart easily when pierced with a fork and the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from heat, add the remaining strawberries and butter and stir until combined. Pour the mixture into a heatproof bowl and let it cool until no longer warm to the touch (you can place in the refrigerator to speed up the process) before pouring over set cheesecake.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately (topping will be loose and messy if served immediately) or let topping set for at least an hour in the fridge for neat slicing.</li>
    </ol>
