<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This strawberry cheesecake is a classic dessert that combines a buttery graham cracker crust with a rich, creamy 
        filling. Topped with a glossy layer of fresh strawberry sauce and slices, it offers a balance of sweet, tart, 
        and velvety textures. Perfect for celebrations or as a weekend indulgence, it’s both visually stunning and satisfying.</p>

    <p>Chilling the cheesecake allows the flavors to meld beautifully, while the strawberry topping adds a refreshing 
        contrast to the dense filling. Whether made as a full cake or individual portions, it’s a crowd-pleaser every time. 
        A touch of vanilla in the filling rounds out the flavor profile.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>170 g graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>74 g unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Cheesecake</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>680 g cream cheese</li>
        <li>200 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Topping</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ lb fresh or frozen strawberries</li>
        <li>50 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ Tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon butter salted or unsalted</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 160C.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Stir in the melted butter until all of the graham cracker crumbs are moistened.</li>
        <li>Press the graham cracker mixture evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9” springform pan. Use the bottom and sides of a glass to help do this. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and sugar using an electric mixer on medium-low speed until smooth, creamy, and completely combined. Scrape the side and bottom of the bowl with a spatula to ensure the ingredients are thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sour cream and vanilla extract until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring until just combined after each addition. Do not over-mix or cheesecake will puff in the oven when baking.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared springform pan and bake at 325F (160C) for 45-50 minutes. The center will be slightly jiggly but the cheesecake should be mostly set.</li>
        <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature until it’s no longer warm then transfer it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 6 hours. Preferably, let it sit overnight. Do not remove the springform collar until you are ready to serve.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch. Add half of the strawberries, the water, and the lemon juice and set the stovetop to medium/low heat. Stir constantly until the strawberries release their juices and begin to fall apart easily when pierced with a fork and the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from heat, add the remaining strawberries and butter and stir until combined. Pour the mixture into a heatproof bowl and let it cool until no longer warm to the touch (you can place in the refrigerator to speed up the process) before pouring over set cheesecake.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately (topping will be loose and messy if served immediately) or let topping set for at least an hour in the fridge for neat slicing.</li>
    </ol>
